# regex_file_search
Python application to search the file system using either a wildcard character (*), or regular expressions.
User choices are made through a window: user selects from pre-defined named expressions (e.g., Word files (.doc, .docx)), or can enter an expression directly.
The user can also filter by dates.
The results of the search are written to a MS Excel file. Results include directory, filename, filesize, and last modified date. The directory and filename are written as hyperlinks.

Main program: file_search_app.py
